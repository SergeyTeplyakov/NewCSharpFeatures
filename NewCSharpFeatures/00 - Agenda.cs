Agenda

 0. Language Features vs. Target Frameworks:
    https://sergeyteplyakov.github.io/Blog/c%23/2024/03/06/CSharp_Language_Features_vs_Target_Frameworks.html
    Check the tables with the latest C# language features per version.
 1. Improving the Design
 2. Improving the Code Expressiveness (Will try to cover as much as we can)
 3. Improving the Performance (won't get here for sure)!

Want to try experimental new features without installing the latest VS?
Or look at lower-level C# code?
